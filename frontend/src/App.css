/* General application styles can go here */

/* FullCalendar event cursor style */
.fc-event {
  cursor: pointer;
}

/* You might want to ensure FullCalendar's own styles are loaded correctly.
   Usually, this is handled by importing them in your main JS/TS file or component,
   e.g., import '@fullcalendar/core/main.css'; 
          import '@fullcalendar/daygrid/main.css';
          import '@fullcalendar/timegrid/main.css';
          import '@fullcalendar/list/main.css';
   If these are not already imported, the calendar might not look right.
   Let's assume they are handled or we can add them later if needed.
